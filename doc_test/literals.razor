# Literals protection

## E-Mail protection

The razor convertor is designed to detect email address such as `john.doe@company.com` or `alert@127.0.0.1`.

But it you type something like `{{ $.john.doe }}{{ $.company.com }}`, it will try to resolve variable john.doe and company.com.

The result would be `<no value><no value>` unless you have defined:

```go
{{- set $ "john" (data "doe = 123.45") }}
{{- set $ "company" (data "com = {{ $.Math.Pi }}") }}
```

In that case, the result of `{{ $.john.doe }}{{ $.company.com }}` will be `123.453.141592653589793`.

## &#64; protection

You can also render the &#64; characters by writing &#64;&#64;.

So this `@` will render &#64;.
